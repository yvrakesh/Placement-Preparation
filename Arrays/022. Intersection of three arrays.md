Naive Approach: 

    Time Complexity : O(n1 * n2 * n3)

    Space Complexity : O(1)

Find commmon element over three loops and then add it to a set and copy that back to array. This is ensure you're not adding any duplicates

Efficient Approach:

    Time Complexity : O(n1 + n2 + n3)

    Space Complexity : O(n1 + n2 + n3)

1. As the arrays are sorted have three pointers towards starting of the three arrrays.

2. Increment each of the pointers as per the condition.

            int prev1 = INT_MIN, prev2 = INT_MIN, prev3 = INT_MIN;
            while(i < n1 && j < n2 && k < n3){
                while(i < n1 && A[i] == prev1)
                    i++;
