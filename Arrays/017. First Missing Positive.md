Naive Approach: 

    Time Complexity : O(n * logn)

    Space Complexity : O(1)

Sort the array and then run a loop and check if current position is not same as it's value then return that. Else return n+1


Efficient Approach:

    Time Complexity : O(n)

    Space Complexity : O(1)

Swap the current position element with it's correct place if it is in between 0 to n

    class Solution{
    public:
        int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& a){
            int n = a.size(), first_pos = -1,i = 0;
            while(i<n){
                if(a[i] > 0 && a[i] <= n && a[i]!=a[a[i]-1]){
                    int temp = a[a[i]-1];
                    a[a[i]-1] = a[i];
                    a[i] = temp;
                }
                else
                    i++;
            }
            for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
                if(a[i] != i+1)
                    return i+1;
            return n+1;
        }
    };
