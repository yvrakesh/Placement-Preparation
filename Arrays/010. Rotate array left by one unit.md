Question Link : https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/cyclically-rotate-an-array-by-one2614/1

Naive Approach : 

Declare a new array and store last element of the original array as first element of new array.

And start at index 1 in new array and copy index 0  to n-1 elements of old array.

Time Complexity : O(n)

Space Complexity : O(n)


Efficient Approach:

Time Complexity : O(n)

Space Complexity : O(1)

Swap last element with each of its adjacent element until it reaches index 0

    void rotate(int a[], int n)
    {
        for(int i=n-2;i>=0;i--){
            int temp = a[i+1];
            a[i+1] = a[i];
            a[i] = temp;
        }
    }
