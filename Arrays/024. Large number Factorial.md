Naive Approach:
    
    Time Complexity : O(n)

Over a loop multiply from 1 to n.

This has very good time complexity, yet it's a naive appproach for very large numbers.

Because there is no integer datatype that can store 1000's of digits.

Another Naive Approach:

    Time Complexity : O(1)

You maintain an array of 1000 integers where you already calculated their factorial in one go.

So when factorial of n is asked you return that element.

But again same issue that integer datatype doesn't support more than 20 digits.


Effective Approach:


    Time Complexity : O(n)

    Space Complexity : O(n)

Store digits in an array and perform arithemetics accordingly.

    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> factorial(int N){
            vector <int> res(3005);
            res[0] = 1;
            int q = 2,len = 1, x = 0, num = 0;
            while(q <= N){
                x = 0;
                num = 0;
                while(x < len){
                    res[x] *= q;
                    res[x] += num;
                    num = res[x]/10;
                    res[x] %= 10;
                    x++;
                }
                while(num != 0){
                    res[len] = num%10;
                    num /= 10;
                    len++;
                }
                q++;
            }
            len--;
            vector <int> temp;
            for(int i=len;i>=0;i--)
                temp.push_back(res[i]);
            return temp;
        }
