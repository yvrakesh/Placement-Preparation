Naive Approach:

    Time Complexity : O(n*m)

    Space Complexity : O(1)

Insertion sort based method. Have a iterator on 1st array.

Compare it with 1st element of second array. If element in 1st array greater then swap both of them.

Now the second array became unsorted. So this can be sorted in O(m) time. 

    class Solution{
    public:
        void merge(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m) {
            for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
                if(arr1[i] > arr2[0]){
                    int temp = arr1[i];
                    arr1[i] = arr2[0];
                    arr2[0] = temp;
                    
                    for(int j=0;j<m-1;j++){
                        if(arr2[j] > arr2[j+1]){
                            int temp = arr2[j];
                            arr2[j] = arr2[j+1];
                            arr2[j+1] = temp;
                        }
                        else
                            break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    };


Efficient Approach:

    Time Complexity : O(n * logn + m * logm)

    Space Complexity : O(1)

Have two pointers on start and end of first array and start of second array.

Compare start of 1st array with start of 2nd array. If not greater increment start of first array.

Else swap start of 2nd array with end of 1st array and increment start of 2nd array, decrement end of 1st array.

    class Solution{
    public:
        void merge(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m) {
            int i=0,j=0,k=n-1;
            while(i < n && j < m){
                if(arr1[i] <= arr2[j])
                    i++;   
                else{
                    int temp = arr1[k];
                    arr1[k] = arr2[j];
                    arr2[j] = temp;
                    j++;
                    k--;
                }
            }
            sort(arr1,arr1+n);
            sort(arr2,arr2+m);
        }
    };
