Efficient Approach:

As given height can't be negative ensure that condition.

Here on each stage we are changing only one element arr[i]. 

We are decreasing it by k so maximum can be on previous element where it's increased by k or last element where it's decreased by k. 

(Since all elements after current one are decreased)

Time Complexity : O(n)

Space Complexity : O(1)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int getMinDiff(int arr[], int n, int k) {
            sort(arr,arr+n);
            int min_diff = arr[n-1]-arr[0];
            for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
                if(arr[i] < k)
                    continue;
                int diff = max(arr[i-1]+k, arr[n-1]-k) - min(arr[0]+k,arr[i]-k);
                if(min_diff > diff)
                    min_diff = diff;
            }
            return min_diff;
        }
    };
